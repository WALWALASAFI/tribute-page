        <p>Malala Yousafzai<br>
        The Nobel Peace Prize 2014<br>
        Born: 12 July 1997, Mingora, Pakistan<br>
        Residence at the time of the award: United Kingdom<br>
        Prize motivation: “for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.”<br>
        Yousafzai was born on 12 July 1997 in the Swat District of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, into a lower-middle-class family.<br>
        She is the daughter of Ziauddin Yousafzai and Toor Pekai Yousafzai.<br>
        Her family is Sunni Muslim of Pashtun ethnicity, belonging to the Yusufzai tribe.<br>
        The family did not have enough money for a hospital birth and Yousafzai was born at home with the help of neighbours.<br>
        She was given her first name Malala (meaning "grief-stricken") after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan.<br>
        At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, her parents, Ziauddin and Tor Pekai, and two chickens.
