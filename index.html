        Prize motivation: “for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.
        ”
        Yousafzai was born on 12 July 1997 in the Swat District of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, into a lower-middle-class family.
        She is the daughter of Ziauddin Yousafzai and Toor Pekai Yousafzai.
        Her family is Sunni Muslim[5] of Pashtun ethnicity, belonging to the Yusufzai tribe.
        The family did not have enough money for a hospital birth and Yousafzai was born at home with the help of neighbours.
        She was given her first name Malala (meaning "grief-stricken") after Malalai of Maiwand, 
        a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan.
        At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, her parents, Ziauddin and Tor Pekai, and two chickens.
